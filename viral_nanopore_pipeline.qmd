# Introduction

This pipeline performs automated processing and analysis of viral sequencing data generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Steps include quality control, basecalling, read filtering, genome assembly, and result visualization.

# Pipeline Steps

## 1. Input Data

The first step in the pipeline involves downloading the `.pod5` raw signal files from the MinION device. This requires remote access to the sequencing machine via SSH.

### 1.1 Accessing the MinION via SSH

You can access the MinION device using the following credentials:

-   **Host name**: `MC-115199`
-   **IP address**: `10.212.1.44`

There are two user options for SSH login:

```         
ssh minit@10.212.1.44
```

password: minit

This command connects to the MinION device (run in terminal, not in Quarto)

**b. Personal User**

```         
 ssh imarches@10.212.1.44 
```

password: \[your personal password\]

after running the command above you will be asked to enter the password. Use a personal password or the default one.

This command connects to the MinION device (run in terminal, not in Quarto)

### 1.2 Navigate to the Sequencing Data in Minion Nanopore

```         
cd/data/run_20250803/no_sample_id/20250803_1227_MC-115199_AYL450_752e4334/pod5_pass/
```

List the available barcode folders and other directories:

```         
ls
```

| Output: barcode01 barcode02 barcode03 barcode07 barcode08 barcode09 barcode10 barcode11 barcode12 barcode13 barcode14 barcode15 barcode16 barcode17 barcode18 barcode19 barcode20 barcode21 barcode22 barcode23 barcode24 mixed unclassified

## Copy Data

Either copy the data with WinSCP to the computer or send it direct to Ramses using this following command:

```         
scp -r /data/run_20250803/no_sample_id/20250803_1227_MC-115199_AYL450_752e4334/pod5_pass imarches@ramses4.itcc.uni-koeln.de:/projects/virology/nanopore/input/
```

## Log in to Ramses

Run the following command to log in:

```         
ssh imarches@ramses4.itcc.uni-koeln.de
```

You will be prompted to :

1.  Enter your SSH key passphrase
2.  Complete Duo two-factor authentication. You will see a prompt like this:

| Duo two-factor login for imarches
| Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:
| Duo Push to +XX XXX XXX9171 Passcode or option (1-1): (Hier you have to write the code that appears in your Duo app) Once authenticated successfully, you will see: Success. Logging you in...

Now are you logged into the server and can proceed with basecalling
