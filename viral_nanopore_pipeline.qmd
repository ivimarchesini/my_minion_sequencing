# Introduction

This pipeline performs automated processing and analysis of viral sequencing data generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Steps include quality control, basecalling, read filtering, genome assembly, and result visualization.

# Pipeline Steps

## 1. Input Data

The first step in the pipeline involves downloading the `.pod5` raw signal files from the MinION device. This requires remote access to the sequencing machine via SSH.

### 1.1 Accessing the MinION via SSH

You can access the MinION device using the following credentials:

-   **Host name**: `MC-115199`
-   **IP address**: `10.212.1.44`

There are two user options for SSH login:

**a. Default user**\
ssh minit\@10.212.1.44 password: minit

**b. Personal User** ssh imarches\@10.212.1.44 password: \[your personal password\]

after running the chunck above you will be asked to enter the password. Use a personal password or the default one.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
# This command connects to the MinION device (run in terminal, not in Quarto)
ssh imarches@10.212.1.44
```
